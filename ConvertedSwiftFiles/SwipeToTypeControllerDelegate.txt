//The code snippet defines the SwipeToTypeControllerDelegate protocol. It declares a delegate method for detecting a left swipe gesture. Here's the analysis of the code:

//The SwipeToTypeControllerDelegate protocol is declared with the protocol keyword.
//The protocol includes a single method: didSwipeLeft(). This method is used to notify the delegate when a left swipe gesture is detected.
//The delegate is responsible for implementing this method and defining the actions to be taken when a left swipe gesture occurs.
//By conforming to the SwipeToTypeControllerDelegate protocol, a class or structure can act as a delegate for detecting left swipe gestures in a SwipeToTypeController or similar controller. It allows the delegate to respond to the swipe gesture and perform custom actions based on it.

import Foundation

protocol SwipeToTypeControllerDelegate: AnyObject {
    func didSwipeLeft()
}
