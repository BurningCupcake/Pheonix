//This file defines a SwiftUI view called ContentView that represents the main content view of the application. Let's break down the implementation:

//The ContentView struct is declared, conforming to the View protocol in SwiftUI.
//It contains several @State properties that represent the state of various UI elements and settings within the view.
//The body property describes the view's content using a VStack.
//Inside the VStack, it displays an image using the system name "globe" from the SF Symbols library.
//The image is scaled to .large size and has the accent color applied to it.
//Below the image, it displays a Text view with the content "Hello, world!".
//The VStack is then padded using the .padding() modifier.
//Lastly, the ContentView includes a struct ContentView_Previews for previewing the view.
//Overall, this file defines the main content view of the application, which displays an image and a text. The specific UI elements and their appearance can be customized based on the state properties defined in the view.
