//This file defines a SwiftUI view called PredictiveTextView. Let's break down the implementation:

//The PredictiveTextView struct is declared, conforming to the View protocol in SwiftUI.
//It contains a single property:
//viewModel: An ObservedObject that holds the PredictiveTextViewModel, responsible for managing the predictive text state.
//The body property describes the view's content using a VStack component.
//Inside the VStack, there is a ForEach loop that iterates over the viewModel.predictiveTextState.suggestions array.
//For each element in the suggestions array, a Text view is created, displaying the suggestion text.
//Each suggestion in the ForEach loop is identified by its value using the id: \.self modifier.
//Overall, this file defines a SwiftUI view that displays a vertical stack of Text views representing the suggestions provided by the PredictiveTextViewModel.

import SwiftUI

struct PredictiveTextView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: PredictiveTextViewModel
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ForEach(viewModel.predictiveTextState.suggestions, id: \.self) { suggestion in
                Text(suggestion)
            }
        }
    }
}
