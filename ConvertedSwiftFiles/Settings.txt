//The provided code defines a Settings class that serves as a centralized storage for various settings related to the keyboard. Here's the analysis of the code:

//The Settings class follows the singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of the class exists by declaring a shared static property.
//The class contains various properties representing different settings categorized under different sections:
//General Settings: These properties control general keyboard settings such as dark mode, auto capitalization, auto correction, and smart quotes.
//Keyboard Appearance Settings: These properties define the appearance of the keyboard, including background color, key color, corner radius, text font, and text color.
//Word Suggestion Settings: These properties control word suggestion settings, including whether word suggestion is enabled and the count of suggested words.
//Eye Tracking Settings: These properties manage eye tracking settings, including whether eye tracking is enabled and the accuracy threshold for eye tracking.
//Dynamic Calibration Settings: These properties handle dynamic calibration settings, such as whether dynamic calibration is enabled and the animation duration for calibration.
//Swipe-to-Type Settings: These properties control swipe-to-type settings, including whether swipe-to-type is enabled and the sensitivity for swipe gestures.
//Blink Gesture Settings: These properties manage blink gesture settings, including whether blink gesture is enabled and the duration threshold for detecting a blink gesture.
//The class provides a private initializer to enforce the singleton pattern, ensuring that the Settings class cannot be instantiated directly from outside the class.
//Each setting is represented by a property with an appropriate data type, such as Bool, UIColor, CGFloat, UIFont, or TimeInterval. The initial values provided are the default values for the settings.
//Clients can access the settings by accessing the shared instance of the Settings class and accessing the individual properties to read or modify the settings.
//Note: The code assumes the availability of the UIColor and UIFont classes from the UIKit framework.
