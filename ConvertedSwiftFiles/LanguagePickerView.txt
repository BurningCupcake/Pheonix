//This file defines a SwiftUI view called LanguagePickerView that displays a picker for selecting a language. Let's break down the implementation:

//The LanguagePickerView struct is declared, conforming to the View protocol in SwiftUI.
//It contains a single property:
//selectedLanguage: A Binding property that holds the currently selected language.
//The body property describes the view's content using a Picker component.
//The Picker displays a list of languages to choose from.
//Each language is represented by a Text view, with its text set to the language name, and a corresponding tag value that represents the language value.
//The selection parameter of the Picker is bound to the selectedLanguage property using the $ prefix to create a two-way binding.
//When a language is selected, the selectedLanguage binding is updated automatically.
//Additional languages can be added to the picker by adding more Text views inside the Picker.
//Overall, this file defines a SwiftUI view that allows the user to select a language from a picker. The selected language is stored in a binding, making it easy to react to changes in the selected language elsewhere in the app.

import SwiftUI

struct LanguagePickerView: View {
    @Binding var selectedLanguage: String
    
    var body: some View {
        Picker("Language", selection: $selectedLanguage) {
            Text("English").tag("English")
            Text("Spanish").tag("Spanish")
            // Add more languages here
        }
    }
}
