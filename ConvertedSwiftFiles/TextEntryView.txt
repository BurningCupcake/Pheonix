//This file defines a SwiftUI view called TextEntryView. Let's break down the implementation:

//The TextEntryView struct is declared, conforming to the View protocol in SwiftUI.
//It contains a single property:
//viewModel: An ObservedObject that holds the TextEntryViewModel, responsible for managing the text entry state.
//The body property describes the view's content using a TextField component.
//The TextField displays a placeholder text of "Enter text" and binds its text value to viewModel.textEntryState.text.
//When the user commits the text entry (e.g., by pressing the return key on the keyboard), the onCommit closure is triggered.
//Inside the onCommit closure, the addCharacter(_:) function is called on the viewModel to handle the committed text. The provided empty string argument appears to be a placeholder and may be replaced with an appropriate value.
//Overall, this file defines a SwiftUI view that presents a TextField for text entry. It binds the text input to the viewModel and triggers the appropriate action when the user commits the text entry.

import SwiftUI

struct TextEntryView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: TextEntryViewModel
    
    var body: some View {
        TextField("Enter text", text: $viewModel.textEntryState.text, onCommit: {
            let _ = viewModel.addCharacter("")
        })
    }
}
