// In this file, we have the CalibrationResult struct that represents the result of the calibration process. Currently, it has one property:

//calibrationPoints: An array of CGPoint representing the calibration points collected during the calibration process.
//This struct serves as a container for the calibration result, allowing you to store and access the calibration points or any other properties you may need for further processing or analysis.

import Foundation

struct CalibrationResult {
    var calibrationPoints: [CGPoint]
    // Add any other properties as needed
}
