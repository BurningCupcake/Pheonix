//The AppDelegate class is the delegate for your application and is responsible for handling various application-level events.

//Here's a breakdown of the key components:

//window: An optional UIWindow property that represents the main window of the application.
//application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:): A required method of the UIApplicationDelegate protocol. It's called when the application finishes launching and provides an opportunity to perform any final initialization. In this method, you're creating a new UIWindow instance, setting its root view controller to an instance of the Keyboard class (presumably your custom keyboard view controller), and making the window visible.
//By setting the rootViewController of the window to your custom keyboard view controller, you're indicating that the keyboard interface should be displayed when the application launches.

//This code snippet assumes that you have a custom Keyboard view controller implemented separately. If not, you'll need to provide the implementation for the Keyboard class to ensure that the appropriate keyboard interface is presented.

import UIKit

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        window = UIWindow()
        window?.rootViewController = Keyboard()
        window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
        return true
    }
}
