//The code snippet defines a protocol called KeyboardInteractionDelegate and provides a default implementation for the didSelectKey(_:textEntryService:) method. Here's the analysis of the code:

//The KeyboardInteractionDelegate protocol defines a set of delegate methods for handling keyboard interaction events. It allows conforming classes to receive and respond to key selection events.
//The didSelectKey(_:textEntryService:) method is one of the delegate methods defined by the protocol. It is called when a key is selected on the keyboard. The method takes two parameters: key of type String representing the selected key, and textEntryService of type TextEntryService providing the text entry service instance.
//The didSelectKey(_:textEntryService:) method has a default implementation provided in the protocol extension. This default implementation does nothing and serves as a placeholder. Conforming classes can override this method to customize the handling of the selected key based on their specific requirements.
//By using a protocol and providing a default implementation, you allow conforming classes to choose whether they want to provide a custom implementation for the delegate method or rely on the default behavior.
//The protocol and its extension are defined within the Foundation framework, indicating that they are part of the basic set of data types and functionalities provided by Apple.

import Foundation

protocol KeyboardInteractionDelegate: AnyObject {
    func didSelectKey(_ key: String, textEntryService: TextEntryService)
    // Add any additional delegate methods for keyboard interaction events
}

extension KeyboardInteractionDelegate {
    func didSelectKey(_ key: String, textEntryService: TextEntryService) {
        // Default implementation for handling key selection
        // You can override this method in conforming classes to handle the selected key
    }
}
