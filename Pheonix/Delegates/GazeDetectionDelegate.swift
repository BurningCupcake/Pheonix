//The code snippet defines a protocol called GazeDetectionDelegate. Here's the analysis of the code:

//The GazeDetectionDelegate protocol defines a single method: gazeDetection(_:didDetectGazeAt:). This method is used to notify the delegate when a gaze has been detected at a specific point.
//The method gazeDetection(_:didDetectGazeAt:) takes two parameters: the gazeDetection instance that detected the gaze, and the point representing the coordinates of the detected gaze.
//The GazeDetectionDelegate protocol is marked with the AnyObject constraint, indicating that it can only be adopted by classes.
//Conforming classes should implement the gazeDetection(_:didDetectGazeAt:) method to handle the gaze detection events. The implementation should define the actions to be performed when a gaze is detected at the given point.
//The GazeDetectionDelegate protocol allows classes to become delegates of a GazeDetection object and receive notifications when gaze is detected. By implementing the delegate method, classes can customize their behavior based on the detected gaze, such as updating the UI, performing further analysis, or triggering additional actions.
