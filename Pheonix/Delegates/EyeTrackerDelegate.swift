//The code provided includes a protocol called EyeTrackerDelegate and an extension that provides default implementations for the delegate methods. Here's the analysis of the code:

//The EyeTrackerDelegate protocol defines a set of methods that a delegate can implement to receive eye tracking events. It includes methods such as eyeTracker(_:didTrackGazePoint:), eyeTrackerDidStartTracking(_:), and eyeTrackerDidStopTracking(_:).
//The eyeTracker(_:didTrackGazePoint:) method notifies the delegate when a gaze point has been tracked. The delegate can implement this method to perform actions based on the gaze point updates.
//The eyeTrackerDidStartTracking(_:) method notifies the delegate when eye tracking starts. The delegate can implement this method to perform any necessary actions when tracking begins.
//The eyeTrackerDidStopTracking(_:) method notifies the delegate when eye tracking stops. The delegate can implement this method to perform any necessary actions when tracking ends.
//The extension provides default implementations for these delegate methods. These default implementations can be used if the conforming class doesn't provide its own implementation. The default implementations serve as placeholders and can be overridden in conforming classes to customize the behavior.
//The EyeTrackerDelegate protocol and its default implementations provide a convenient way for classes to receive eye tracking events and perform actions based on those events. Conforming classes can implement the necessary delegate methods to handle specific eye tracking events according to their requirements.
