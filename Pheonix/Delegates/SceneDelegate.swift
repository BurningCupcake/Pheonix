//The code snippet defines the `SceneDelegate` class, which conforms to the `UIWindowSceneDelegate` protocol. It sets up the initial window and root view controller for the app's scene. Here's the analysis of the code:

//- The `SceneDelegate` class is responsible for managing the app's scene and configuring the window and root view controller.

//- The `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` method is called when the scene is about to be connected to the session. It receives the scene object, the session object, and the connection options.

//- Inside the `scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)` method, the code first checks if the `scene` parameter can be cast to `UIWindowScene`. If not, it returns early and does nothing.

//- If the `scene` parameter is successfully cast to `UIWindowScene`, a new `UIWindow` object is created using the provided `windowScene`.

//- The `rootViewController` property of the window is set to an instance of `UIHostingController`, which is used to host a SwiftUI view as the root view controller. In this case, the `ContentView` is used as the root view.

//- The `window` property of the `SceneDelegate` is assigned the newly created window.

//- Finally, the window is made key and visible by calling `makeKeyAndVisible()`.

//- This setup allows the SwiftUI `ContentView` to be displayed as the root view of the app's window when the scene is connected.

        let window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
        window.rootViewController = UIHostingController(rootView: ContentView())
