//The code snippet defines an enumeration called GestureType. Here's the analysis of the code:

//The GestureType enumeration represents different types of gestures. Currently, it only has one case, blink, which indicates a blink gesture.
//The blink case represents a specific type of gesture, typically associated with the action of quickly closing and opening the eyes.
//By using an enumeration, you can define different types of gestures as separate cases. This allows for type safety and enables the compiler to enforce exhaustive handling of all gesture types when used in a switch statement.
//You can extend the GestureType enumeration by adding more cases to represent additional types of gestures, such as swipes, taps, or other custom gestures.
//The enumeration is defined within the Foundation framework, indicating that it is part of the basic set of data types and functionalities provided by Apple.

import Foundation

enum GestureType {
    case blink
}
