//The provided code defines a GestureRecognition class responsible for recognizing a specific gesture based on the changes in the eye state. Here's the analysis of the code:

//The GestureRecognition class has the following properties:
//delegate: A weak reference to an object conforming to the GestureRecognitionDelegate protocol. The delegate will receive updates when a gesture is recognized.
//previousEyeState: An EyeState variable representing the previous state of the eye.
//The processEyeState(_:) function is responsible for processing the current eye state and determining if a gesture has been recognized. It performs the following steps:
//Compares the previous eye state with the current eye state.
//If the previous eye state was "open" and the current eye state is "closed," it indicates that a gesture (in this case, a blink) has occurred.
//The GestureRecognitionDelegate is then notified of the recognized gesture via the gestureRecognition(_:didRecognizeGesture:) method.
//The GestureRecognitionDelegate protocol defines a single method gestureRecognition(_:didRecognizeGesture:) that will be implemented by the delegate to handle the recognized gesture.
//Note: The code assumes that the GestureRecognitionDelegate protocol is implemented by another object that will receive updates when a gesture is recognized. Additionally, the EyeState enum is assumed to be defined elsewhere and represents the state of the eye (open or closed).
