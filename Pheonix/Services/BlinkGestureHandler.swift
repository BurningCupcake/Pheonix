//The provided code defines a BlinkGestureHandler class that handles blink gestures. Here's the analysis of the code:

//The BlinkGestureHandler class has the following properties:
//delegate: A weak reference to an object that conforms to the BlinkGestureHandlerDelegate protocol. It allows the handler to notify the delegate when a blink gesture is detected.
//previousEyeState: An instance of EyeState enum that represents the previous state of the eye (open or closed).
//The processEyeState(_:) method is used to process the current eye state and determine if a blink gesture has occurred. It takes an eyeState parameter of type EyeState, which represents the current state of the eye (open or closed).
//If the previous eye state was open and the current eye state is closed, it triggers the didDetectBlink() method on the delegate object.
//It updates the previousEyeState property with the current eye state, so it can be used for comparison in the next call to processEyeState(_:).
//Overall, this code provides a simple mechanism to detect blink gestures. When the eye state transitions from open to closed, it triggers the didDetectBlink() method on the delegate, allowing the consumer of this class to handle the blink gesture detection accordingly.

class BlinkGestureHandler {
    weak var delegate: BlinkGestureHandlerDelegate?
    private var previousEyeState: EyeState = .open
    
    func processEyeState(_ eyeState: EyeState) {
        if previousEyeState == .open && eyeState == .closed {
            delegate?.didDetectBlink()
        }
        previousEyeState = eyeState
    }
}
