//The provided code defines an EyeTracker class that utilizes ARKit's face tracking capabilities to track the user's eye gaze. Here's the analysis of the code:

//The EyeTracker class conforms to the ARSessionDelegate protocol and serves as the delegate for ARSession events.
//The class has the following properties:
//delegate: A weak reference to an object conforming to the EyeTrackerDelegate protocol, which will receive updates about the tracked gaze points.
//session: An optional ARSession instance used for face tracking.
//The startTracking() function is responsible for initiating the eye tracking process. It performs the following steps:
//Checks if face tracking is supported on the device by verifying the ARFaceTrackingConfiguration.isSupported property.
//Creates an instance of ARFaceTrackingConfiguration to configure the AR session for face tracking.
//Initializes an ARSession instance and assigns it to the session property.
//Sets the EyeTracker object as the delegate of the AR session.
//Runs the AR session with the configured face tracking configuration.
//The stopTracking() function pauses the AR session by calling the pause() method on the session property.
//The ARSessionDelegate methods are implemented to receive updates about the AR session:
//In the session(_:didUpdate:) method, the code extracts the first ARFaceAnchor from the received anchors and retrieves the transform of the left eye.
//The left eye transform's columns.3.x and columns.3.y values are used to create a CGPoint representing the gaze point.
//The gaze point is then passed to the EyeTrackerDelegate via the eyeTracker(_:didTrackGazePoint:) method.
//The session(_:didFailWithError:) method is implemented to handle errors that may occur during the AR session. It simply prints the error message.
//Note: The code assumes that the EyeTrackerDelegate is implemented by another object that will receive updates about the tracked gaze points. Additionally, it assumes that the ARKit framework and necessary permissions are set up correctly.
