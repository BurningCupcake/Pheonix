//The provided code defines a DependencyInjection class responsible for managing dependencies and providing instances of various classes. It follows the Singleton design pattern.

//Here's the analysis of the code:

//The DependencyInjection class has the following properties:
//keyboardInteraction: An optional KeyboardInteraction instance.
//eyeTrackingController: An optional EyeTrackingController instance.
//gazeDetection: An optional GazeDetection instance.
//textEntryService: An optional TextEntryService instance.
//settings: An optional Settings instance.
//wordSuggestion: An optional WordSuggestion instance.
//eyeTracker: An optional EyeTracker instance.
//The class provides a shared instance via the shared property, following the Singleton pattern.
//The private initializer ensures that the class remains a singleton and cannot be instantiated from outside the class.
//The class provides several functions to retrieve instances of various dependencies:
//getKeyboardInteraction(): Returns a KeyboardInteraction instance. If the instance doesn't exist, it creates a new instance using the default keyboard layout and the TextEntryService obtained from getTextEntryService().
//getEyeTrackingController(): Returns an EyeTrackingController instance. If the instance doesn't exist, it creates a new instance using the EyeTracker obtained from EyeTracker() and the WordSuggestion obtained from getWordSuggestion().
//getGazeDetection(): Returns a GazeDetection instance. If the instance doesn't exist, it creates a new instance using the CalibrationDelegateImplementation as the calibration delegate.
//getTextEntryService(): Returns a TextEntryService instance. If the instance doesn't exist, it creates a new instance.
//getSettings(): Returns a Settings instance. If the instance doesn't exist, it retrieves the shared instance from Settings.shared.
//getWordSuggestion(): Returns a WordSuggestion instance. If the instance doesn't exist, it creates a new instance.
//Each function checks if the corresponding dependency instance exists. If it does, it returns the existing instance; otherwise, it creates a new instance, assigns it to the respective property, and returns the new instance.
//The class ensures that each dependency is created only once and reused for subsequent calls to the corresponding functions, providing a centralized way to manage dependencies and avoid unnecessary instantiation.
//Note: The code assumes that the dependencies are set up correctly and their initialization and configuration details are handled outside the scope of this code snippet.
