//The code snippet defines the `WordSuggestionDelegate` protocol. It declares a delegate method for providing word suggestions. Here's the analysis of the code:

//- The `WordSuggestionDelegate` protocol is declared with the `protocol` keyword.

//- The protocol includes a single method: `wordSuggestion(_:didSuggestWords:)`. This method is used to pass an array of suggested words to the delegate.

//- The method takes two parameters:
//  - `wordSuggestion`: An instance conforming to the `WordSuggestion` protocol. It can be used by the delegate to interact with the word suggestion functionality.
//  - `suggestedWords`: An array of strings representing the suggested words.

//- The delegate is responsible for implementing this method and handling the suggested words appropriately.

//- By conforming to the `WordSuggestionDelegate` protocol, a class or structure can act as a delegate for receiving word suggestions from a `WordSuggestion` object and perform custom actions based on those suggestions.

import Foundation

// WordSuggestionDelegate protocol
protocol WordSuggestionDelegate: AnyObject {
    func wordSuggestion(_ wordSuggestion: WordSuggestion, didSuggestWords suggestedWords: [String])
}
