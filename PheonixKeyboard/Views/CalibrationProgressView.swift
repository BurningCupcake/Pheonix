//The code defines a SwiftUI view called CalibrationProgressView that displays the progress of a calibration process. Here's the analysis of the code:

//The CalibrationProgressView struct takes a binding to a progress value, which represents the calibration progress as a double value between 0 and 1.
//The body of the view consists of a vertical stack (VStack) containing three elements:
//A Text view displaying the title "Calibration Progress" with a large title font and some padding.
//A ProgressView displaying the progress using a circular progress view style. It takes the progress value and a total value of 1, indicating that the progress is relative to a full completion.
//Another Text view displaying the progress percentage by multiplying the progress value by 100 and converting it to an integer.
//The view applies appropriate fonts and padding to the text elements.
//The CalibrationProgressView can be used to visually represent the progress of a calibration process by binding the progress value to a variable and updating it as the calibration progresses.

import SwiftUI

struct CalibrationProgressView: View {
    @Binding var progress: Double
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Calibration Progress")
                .font(.title)
                .padding()
            
            ProgressView(value: progress, total: 1)
                .progressViewStyle(CircularProgressViewStyle())
                .padding()
            
            Text("\(Int(progress * 100))% Complete")
                .font(.headline)
        }
    }
}
